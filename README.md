# railway-reservations
This program enables us to choose the train even when there is no necessity to fill a form at
the railway registration counter, that is, we can directly select from the choices provided for us
with the number of seats available and the seats that can be booked. It is completely developed in
c language without using graphics. This simplifies the risk and makes things faster in the mode
of railways.
